# WildLifeZoo
I think the program that best showcases my abilities is the wildlife zoo project. I think I did well writing my classes and using the inheritance. I did find using external files kind of difficult but I think I had it figured out in the end. I tried to keep as much out of main that I could, but I didn't do very well adding comments to my work.
